# PrediCare Project - AI Breast Cancer Diagnosis
Welcome to the PrediCare project, the culmination of a 3-month data science bootcamp at Spiced Academy/neue Fische GmbH. The dedicated effort over a four-week duration has resulted in a project focused on advancing AI breast cancer diagnosis with ultrasound images through image recognition.

## Project Components:
- predicare_part_1.ipynb
- predicare_part_2.ipynb
- predicare_functions.py
- predicare_presentation.pdf

Both notebooks, `predicare_part_1.ipynb` and `predicare_part_2.ipynb`, contain the code detailing the comprehensive main process of our project. The `predicare_functions.py` file holds essential functions for analysis, requiring importation at the beginning of the notebooks.

### predicare_part_1.ipynb:
This notebook adopts a structured approach, commencing with an exploration of the dataset's structure and composition. A baseline model is then established using the raw dataset as a performance benchmark. Subsequent steps involve cleaning and augmentation to address imbalances within the dataset.

### predicare_part_2.ipynb:
The segmentation phase leverages the U-Net CNN architecture, incorporating both processed and original images. U-Net training utilizes ground truth masks, highlighting specific regions of interest. The image classification section employs transfer learning with ResNet50.

The conclusive outcomes and insights are presented in the predicare_presentation.pdf file.

## Environment setup

For running the notebooks, the following libraries are needed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- Scikit-image
- SciPy
- Tensorflow/Keras


## Statement
The success of the PrediCare project is a result of the collaborative efforts of Helene Schönewolf, María José Zapata, and Yen Ramisch. While all team members contributed to the project, the modeling and coding tasks were carried out in equal parts by María José Zapata and Yen Ramisch.
